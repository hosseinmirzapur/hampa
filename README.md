## Progressive Web App (PWA) Installation 📱

Hampa is a Progressive Web App (PWA), which means you can install it directly to your mobile device's home screen and use it like a native application, even offline!

### How to Install:

1.  **Visit the Application**: Open the Hampa application in your mobile browser (e.g., Chrome on Android, Safari on iOS). Ensure you are visiting the deployed version over HTTPS.
2.  **Look for the Install Prompt**:
    *   **Custom Prompt**: You might see a banner at the bottom of the screen prompting you to "Install App". Tap this button to add Hampa to your home screen.
    *   **Browser's Native Option**: If the custom prompt doesn't appear immediately, you can usually find an "Add to Home Screen" or "Install App" option in your browser's menu (e.g., Chrome's three-dot menu, Safari's Share Sheet).
3.  **Confirm Installation**: Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

Once installed, Hampa will appear as an icon on your home screen, providing a fast, reliable, and engaging experience.
